The 23-year-old is a target for Manchester United, Manchester City and Chelsea, and is viewed as one of the most complete central midfielders in world football. Moyes' West Ham are reaping the rewards of Rice's rapid rise to the top of the game, and have a Europa League quarter-final date with Lyon to look forward to after recently seeing off six-time winners Sevilla over two legs. That victory again raised the question of whether Rice is ready to play for a top club competing in the Champions League, but Moyes told the media at his latest press conference that he is not for sale - and even if he was, a bid north of ��150m would have to be made for West Ham to even think about parting ways. "The first thing to say is that he is not for sale," Moyes remarked. "But if you are interested, it will be north of that, because ��100m was cheap last summer and ��150m just now would be minimum - but he is not for sale." Rice, who has now been capped 29 times by England, has seen the jostling for his signature likened to pursuits of Harry Kane in the past, and Moyes admitted that he looked at how Spurs dealt with multiple bids last summer and will act accordingly. "I look at what Tottenham did with Harry Kane, albeit it in a different way," he added. "They said, 'no, there is a price and if someone wants to pay the price, then we'd probably do it. If they don't then he's not going anywhere'. That's it, they have kept him. "In many ways, the football clubs are the people in charge, they've got the contracts. "There will be times when players have got the power, but at the moment we have got Declan on the best part of a three-and-a-half-year contract - just like Tottenham have got Harry Kane on a contract and they control what happens." Elsewhere, 90min understands West Ham have paused new contract talks with Rice's midfielder partner Tomas Soucek until the end of the season. The 27-year-old's deal at London Stadium runs until the summer of 2024, like Rice's, although West Ham have the option of an extra year written into the latter's contract.
