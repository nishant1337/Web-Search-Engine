By Sean Walsh Dec 20, 2021 | Updated: Apr 1, 2022, 9:25 AM GMT+1 The World Cup is on the horizon / Clive Rose/GettyImages The 2022 World Cup is under a year away, and England are among the favourites to go all the way in Qatar. After going so close at Euro 2020, Gareth Southgate's men have to be considered one of the best teams at FIFA's showpiece event next winter. But who should be in the 23-man squad to go to Qatar? It's time for the return of 90min's 'Who's on the Plane' power rankings series... *Last Update: 17th March 2022 23. Tyrone Mings (Down 2) Mings is Aston Villa captain / CARL RECINE/GettyImages Tyrone Mings hugely benefits from three key factors - he's massive, he's left-footed and he's a leader. Hardly an amazing defender, his spot on the plane is certainly up for grabs - he'll have to shine for Steven Gerrard and Aston Villa if he wants to strap himself in. 22. Nick Pope (Down 2) Pope missed Euro 2020 with injury / Sebastian Frej/MB Media/GettyImages It's hard to have any strong feelings over the selection of the third-choice goalkeeper, but Nick Pope just about gets the nod over Sam Johnstone and Dean Henderson for now - essentially because he's a Premier League regular with Burnley. 21. Conor Coady (New Entry) Conor Coady has skippered England under Southgate / Nicol�� Campo/GettyImages England love playing three at the back, even in games you'd expect them to dominate, and that system could open the door for Wolves skipper Conor Coady. The Liverpudlian has been playing with a three-man defence for Wanderers for what feels like decades, and he's widely regarded as one of the Premier League's best leaders. Authority is what Southgate likes and the fact Coady has skippered his country could be a key factor. 20. Tammy Abraham (New Entry) Tammy Abraham has thrived at Roma / Ciancaphoto Studio/GettyImages Marcus Rashford is struggling and Dominic Calvert-Lewin always seems to be injured, opening the door for the rejuvenated Tammy Abraham to claim a spot in England's World Cup squad. Scoring goals for fun in Serie A, Abraham looks a cut above currently and it's hard to argue against him being Kane's understudy if he keeps it up. 19. Kalvin Phillips (-) Kalvin Phillips remains in England's plans / Jonathan Moscrop/GettyImages If there's one area that England are perhaps a little light in, it's central midfield. Kalvin Phillips established himself as a favourite of Gareth Southgate's at Euro 2020, but his season with Leeds hasn't gone as planned and he has struggled with injury. Despite that, he's on track to feature providing he continues playing at the highest level. 18. Luke Shaw (-) Shaw's form has nosedived this season / Marc Atkins/GettyImages Luke Shaw's stock at the time of his goal in the Euro 2020 final had soared to Jupiter - there was a genuine case that he was the best left-back in the world. But he's been brought crashing back to earth this season and has a fight on his hands to keep Alex Telles out of the Man Utd team - if he falls out of favour then he may have to forego his seat on the plane, too. 17. John Stones (-) Stones has scarcely featured for Man City this season / Nicol�� Campo/GettyImages After working his way back into Manchester City's starting XI last season, it seems that Pep Guardiola would now prefer Aymeric Laporte to partner Ruben Dias instead of John Stones. Nevertheless, he remains one of Southgate's best options at centre-back. 16. Jack Grealish (Down 3) Grealish left boyhood club Aston Villa after Euro 2020 / Michael Regan/GettyImages Sure, Jack Grealish probably isn't worth ��100m and isn't standing out as much at Man City, but he's still top class and brings an X-factor that few other Englishmen can. Needs to deliver more though to be sure. 15. Bukayo Saka (Up 1) Saka has stepped up for Arsenal / Jonathan Moscrop/GettyImages Bukayo Saka is an international manager's dream, being able to play in various positions across the pitch to a high standard. Memories of that penalty miss are strong, but wrongfully gloss over how useful he was at the Euros as a whole. 14. Aaron Ramsdale (Up 1) Ramsdale has quickly become a fan favourite at Arsenal / Jonathan Moscrop/GettyImages If you saw Aaron Ramsdale's Arsenal renaissance coming, you're a liar. Bloke's been playing out of his skin after conceding about 200 goals in the last two seasons. Still, at least Jordan Pickford has some competition (both for his spot and for the vibes he brings to the squad). 13. Jude Bellingham (Up 1) Bellingham is already one of Borussia Dortmund's key players / Nicol�� Campo/GettyImages Away from the harsh Premier League spotlight, Jude Bellingham has established himself as one of the very best players in the Bundesliga. Who knows just how good the teenager will be by the time the World Cup rolls around... 12. Kyle Walker (-) Kyle Walker's versatility is a huge asset / Robin Jones/GettyImages Kyle Walker's experience, recovery pace and versatility in a back three mean that he has to be on the plane - even if Gareth Southgate did omit him from the squad for England's March international friendlies. 11. Ben Chilwell (-) Chilwell shone for Chelsea this season prior to injury / Nicol�� Campo/GettyImages Luke Shaw may have wrestled the England left-back spot from Ben Chilwell last year, but the Chelsea man has taken it back after a superb start to the 2021/22 campaign. Not even a serious knee injury, which has ended his season, is likely to take away his World Cup dream. 10. Harry Maguire (-) Maguire was immense at the Euros....but has struggled since / Nicol�� Campo/GettyImages Harry Maguire has been disappointing this season, though he's arguably still England's best, and most experienced, option at centre-back. Nevertheless, he'll need a strong partner alongside him, or potentially slotting into a back three. 9. Jordan Henderson (-) Henderson is one of the most senior players in the England setup / Michael Regan/GettyImages Father Time and injuries may be catching up with Jordan Henderson - the latter restricted his involvement at the Euros - but Southgate still depends on him as one of his most senior options in a young England team. 8. Jordan Pickford (-) Pickford was sensational at Euro 2020 / Danilo Di Giovanni/GettyImages A stunning Euro 2020 - which may have seen him win the Player of the Tournament award rather than Gianluigi Donnarumma if the penalty shootout went the other way - elevated Jordan Pickford in the eyes of England fans. He's number one unless his form falls off a cliff. 7. Reece James (Down 1) James has been one of Chelsea's standout players / Catherine Ivill/GettyImages Reece James' all-action 2021/22 campaign has seen him draw comparisons to Steven Gerrard. He's a right-back. Unbelievable. 6. Mason Mount (Down 1) Mount is a favourite for club and country / Robin Jones/GettyImages It doesn't usually matter what role Mason Mount is playing - he'll find a way to make teams better and make the players around him fit together. 5. Declan Rice (Up 2) Rice has been outstanding for West Ham and England / Matthew Ashton - AMA/GettyImages While he didn't set the world alight at the Euros, Declan Rice has quietly been one of the best players in the Premier League since the summer. Whether he's at West Ham or a club competing for the top honours, he needs to be on the plane. 4. Trent Alexander-Arnold (-) Alexander-Arnold is back to his best / Jonathan Moscrop/GettyImages Remember when there was a debate over whether Trent Alexander-Arnold should even be in the England squad? Funny times. The right-back is back to his best and scaring defenders more than ever before. 3. Phil Foden (-) Foden's versatility is a huge plus / Danilo Di Giovanni/GettyImages In terms of talent, Phil Foden should be mentioned in the same breath as Wayne Rooney and Paul Gascoigne. Hell, he's even building a CV to compare with them, too. One of the Premier League's best players that can play anywhere in a forward line and in midfield. 2. Raheem Sterling (-) Sterling is a key figure under Gareth Southgate / Michael Regan/GettyImages Here's a thought - if Man City had won the Champions League and England had won Euro 2020, would Raheem Sterling have been on the Ballon d'Or podium? It's hard to argue against it. He's easily one of the players Southgate relies on most, regardless of whether he's a regular in Pep Guardiola's side or not. 1. Harry Kane (-) Kane is close to becoming England's record goalscorer / Nicol�� Campo/GettyImages England captain - whether you like it or not - and the first name on Gareth Southgate's teamsheet. Hard to argue with that, in all honestly.
