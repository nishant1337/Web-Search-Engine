Antonio Rudiger's 35-yard piledriver put the Blues ahead but they proceeded to be battered by Brentford, who put four goals past Edouard Mendy on the one-year anniversary of the infamous 5-2 defeat to West Brom. It was hardly the best way to prepare for a Champions League quarter-final first leg against La Liga leaders Real Madrid on Wednesday, but Tuchel insisted he will not change anything ahead of the match. "I will now refuse to make a drama out of it. Why should we? We do what we do," he stressed. "We don���t need special things now. We need to rely on the things and trust that we have built throughout the whole season and the whole year.

We need to do our stuff better, on a higher level, more committed, more mature, and we can���t lose concentration for a minute because you can get punished. It is very untypical of us.��� Tuchel went on to claim that he does not care how Real will have viewed the game. "I don���t know - it is their problem,��� he said. "We deal with our problems and I don���t read too much into the results of other matches because it is proven that it has nothing to do with Wednesday���s match. "It is a bit harder because we have to digest a big loss and we didn���t see it really coming and also not within the match. I did not see it coming and the players did not see it coming. So I am involved in it and I will find a way to digest it and prepare for Real Madrid and Real Madrid will do what they want to do with it."
