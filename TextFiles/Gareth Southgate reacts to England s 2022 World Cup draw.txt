The 2018 semi-finalists were drawn in Group B at the Doha Exhibition & Convention Center on Friday afternoon, with the USA, Iran and the winner of the playoff between Wales and either Scotland or Ukraine joining them in their pool. If England progress from Group B as winners as expected then they will face the Group A runners-up, which could be Qatar, Ecuador, Senegal or the Netherlands, while a tie against either holders France or Argentina would likely await in the quarter-finals.

What we���ve done well is approaching the group, getting out, regardless of the opposition, and go from there. ���All of our thoughts are with Ukraine, when that tie is played, it���s irrelevant it���s for the rest of us to adapt and adjust." Asked whether he was happy with England's World Cup group, Southgate added: ���When you���re seeded, you get the advantage of missing out on the big six or seven teams. For most of the seeds they would be pleased with the group they get. "There are some really highly-ranked teams in Pot 2, the USA are an interesting one. I���ve got to know (USA coach) Gregg Berhalter quite well - we were smiling at the end, they���ve got some good players and we know what they���re capable of as a nation.��� About Privacy Policy Cookie Policy Contact Us Careers Terms & Conditions FANSIDED Accessibility Statement FOLLOW US �� 2022 Minute Media - All rights reserved
