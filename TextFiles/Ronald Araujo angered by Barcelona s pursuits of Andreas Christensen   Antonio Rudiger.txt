Araujo's contract expires at the end of the 2022/23 season and he has not agreed fresh terms with Bar��a just yet, while he has been heavily linked with a move to Manchester United in recent months. Barcelona's most recent contract offer would see Araujo quadruple his wages, though he would still remain one of the lowest-paid members of the first team. And Sport now report the Uruguayan's camp have learned Barcelona have offered a much bigger salary in order to bring Christensen to the club this summer - a deal club president Joan Laporta all but confirmed last week - while their aggressive interest in Rudiger hasn't gone down well either. The Catalan club are also keen to sign a third Chelsea defender in Cesar Azpilicueta, despite an extension clause in his contract kicking in recently.

Jamie Spencer | Apr 1, 2022 Ultimately, Araujo wants to remain at Barcelona - he has a great relationship with head coach Xavi and believes his project has legs. However, the club recognise the player's stance and so they hold the leverage in negotiations. Araujo believes he is deserving of a bigger contract not least because of his impressive displays this season, notably starting out of position at right-back and scoring in Barcelona's 4-0 Clasico win at Real Madrid last month.
