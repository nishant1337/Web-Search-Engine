Following his heroics in leading his nation to the European Championships of 2016 and 2020, the Dragons are just one game away from qualifying for the World Cup for the first time since 1958 - their only appearance in the competition to date. Wales came second in Group E of World Cup qualification, finishing five points behind Belgium to secure a spot in the play-offs. In their semi final, Bale scored twice against Austria to earn a 2-1 win and set up a winner-takes-all encounter in the final. But while the other UEFA play-offs have concluded - Poland beating Sweden and Portugal besting North Macedonia - Wales are yet to find out who they are playing.

Krishan Davis | Apr 1, 2022 Wales 2022 World Cup play-off final potential opponents Wales will play one of Scotland or Ukraine. All three teams are part of Path A in the second round of UEFA qualification for the World Cup. As a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the semi final between Ukraine and Scotland has not been played. The Ukrainian FA submitted a request to FIFA to postpone that semi final, alongside the path final. It was granted, though to avoid fixture congestion the game between Wales and Austria went ahead. When is Wales' World Cup play-off final? Right now, it remains uncertain. The country of Ukraine is still dealing with Russia's barbaric invasion and its horrific effects. There has been some talk of the second semi final being played in June, though Scotland manager Steve Clarke has admitted he is sceptical over the game going ahead that soon. ���The very short answer is ���no���,��� he said when asked whether there had been an update on the play-off. ���I would imagine everyone is waiting until this round of matches is out of the way and then see how the situation develops. But, obviously, it���s not looking great at this moment. ���If you���re asking me now will the game go ahead in June then it���s going to be difficult. But it���s a situation we can���t control, so I���ll focus on these two friendlies and make sure we get something out of the games in this camp."

The draw for the group stage has already been made, with Bale and Wales set to take on England, the USA and Iran if they get past Scotland or Ukraine in the play-off final. Wales and England faced off at Euro 2016, when the Three Lions earned a late win in the group stage before being knocked out by Iceland, while Wales enjoyed a historic run to the semi finals before being downed by eventual winners Portugal.
