Livramento was called up by England Under-21 boss Lee Carsley for the March internationals even though the right-back was carrying a knee injury. Hasenhuttl was staggered to see Livramento star in both games for the U21s against Andorra and Albania as he believed there was an agreement in place for this not to happen. Asked about Livramento and his England duties after Southampton's draw with Leeds at the weekend, the Austrian responded: "[I'm] not happy at all, as that wasn't the message we had before games. "[England U21s] is meant to be a team that develops players, but they start him twice, so what can I do.

Graeme Bailey | Apr 2, 2022 "This is always a problem when you speak about something and afterwards it doesn't come in this way. "I understand that [Carsley] needs to win his games but we want to take care of a young player, and U21s are a team that develops players, then you let him play twice from the beginning. I think it is not good for the player, but what can I say?" Despite these issues, Hasenhuttl opted to play Livramento for the full 90 minutes in Saturday's 1-1 draw at Elland Road. "We have our games to play and our matches to win," Hasenhuttl explained. "For us he is a very important player and he was very good again today, so it's important that his knee doesn't show a reaction in the moment but we must be careful."
