With the novelty of the tournament being held in a country without much footballing history, it means even the most die-hard fan may not be aware of the cities and stadiums. So here's the lowdown of the regions and venues that will play host to the 2022 World Cup... 1. Al Janoub Stadium Al Janoub Stadium was opened in 2019 / GIUSEPPE CACACE/GettyImages City: Al Wakrah Capacity: 40,000 Games hosted: Group stage One of Qatar's various home arenas, the Al Janoub Stadium hosted the 2020 AFC Champions League final and sees a fair share of club football as the home of Al-Wakrah SC. The wavy designs (literally) of the seating are inspired by the region's traditional Dhow boats which are used by pearl divers in the Persian Gulf. 2. Khalifa International Stadium The stadium was renovated in preparation for the World Cup / Maja Hitij/GettyImages City: Al Rayyan Capacity: 40,000 Games hosted: Group stage, round of 16, third place playoff Look familiar, Liverpool fans? This is where you beat Flamengo in the final of 2019 Club World Cup. While seats can be added to boost the capacity for events, it's still unclear whether the stadium will house more than 40,000 fans for the tournament 3. Stadium 974 Last visit to Stadium 974, for #FIFAArabCup 3rd place match between #Egypt & #Qatar both having lost to late goals in the semi finals, it���s #QatarNationalDay2021 today, a big crowd expected. Commentary ? around ??, @keatings on the final later #Tunisa v #Algeria pic.twitter.com/YFgG4nW8tE ��� John Roder (@johnrodercomm) December 18, 2021 City: Doha Capacity: 40,000 Games hosted: Group stage, round of 16 Stadium 974 may sound like a planet from the Star Wars franchise, but it's one of the eight host stadiums for the 2022 World Cup. Who'd have thought? From the outside, Stadium 974 looks more like a docking bay. Or the stadium from Call of Duty: Warzone. Hey, at least there's layers of character about this ground. 4. Al Thumama Stadium Italy should feel at home if they qualify / Matthew Ashton - AMA/GettyImages City: Doha Capacity: 40,000 Games hosted: Group stage, round of 16, quarter finals One of the tournament's four stadiums situated in Doha, the design of the Al Thumama Stadium is based on the traditional Middle Eastern taqiyah hat. Half of the stadium's seats will be donated to other countries at the conclusion of the World Cup. 5. Ahmed bin Ali Stadium The stadium opened at the end of 2020 / Matthew Ashton - AMA/GettyImages City: Al Rayyan Capacity: 44,740 Games hosted: Group stage, round of 16 Al Rayyan's original Ahmed bin Ali Stadium was built in 2003, but apparently that wasn't up to scratch and was demolished in 2015. 90% of the rubble from that old stadium went into building the new one or to public art projects. 6. Education City Stadium Education City Stadium's opening was delayed until late 2020 / James Williamson - AMA/GettyImages City: Al Rayyan Capacity: 45,350 Games hosted: Group stage, last 16, quarter finals Education City is merely the name of a development within the city of Al Rayyan, but now also plays host to a World Cup calibre stadium - which has been nicknamed the 'diamond in the desert'. 7. Al Bayt Stadium Al Bayt Stadium is one of two stadiums with a capacity over 60,000 / Matthew Ashton - AMA/GettyImages City: Al Khor Capacity: 60,000 Games hosted: Group stage, round of 16, quarter finals, semi finals If you were lucky enough to book a hotel room at Al Bayt Stadium, then you'll be able to enjoy a balcony view of the pitch. At the end of the World Cup, the stadium will be downscaled by nearly half the capacity, the hotel expanded, a shopping mall opened and another sport facility built. 8. Lusail Iconic Stadium Let's hope it will be iconic / Eurasia Sport Images/GettyImages City: Lusail Capacity: 80,000 Games hosted: Group stage, round of 16, quarter finals, semi finals, final With under a year to go until the final, an official game is still yet to be played at the Lusail Iconic Stadium. Like many of the other stadiums on this list, Lusail Iconic Stadium will undergo a severe reduction in capacity at the conclusion of the World Cup.
