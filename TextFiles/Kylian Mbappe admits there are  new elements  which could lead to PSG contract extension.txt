Mbappe asked to join Real Madrid last summer and has long been expected to move to the Santiago Bernabeu once the current season comes to an end, but PSG have been aggressive in their attempts to keep Mbappe and have effectively handed him a blank cheque - something which has not yet been enough. Speaking to Amazon Prime after bagging two goals and three assists in Sunday's 5-1 win over Lorient, Mbappe insisted that there is still a real chance that he stays in Paris beyond this summer. "If I had made my decision, I would have said so," he said. "I don't have to answer to anyone. If I had made the decision, I would have taken responsibility. The good and the bad things, I have always assumed them by the way. "I don't have to hide, I didn't kill anyone. I just want to make the best decision I can.

He was later asked outright whether staying at PSG was a possibility, to which he responded: "Yes, of course." Mbappe did, however, stress that his delay in making a decision does not necessarily mean that he is leaning towards remaining in Paris. "I don't know [whether it is a good sign] frankly," he said. "Having the affection of the people here has always been nice. I thank them for that. A whole stadium screaming your name, it's not just anything."
