Rudiger's current deal expires at the end of the season, and 90min understands that although he is awaiting the outcome of the club's takeover, he is still likely to walk away on a free transfer in the summer. As many as 11 top European sides have expressed an interest in the player with Man Utd, Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-Germain among those chasing his signature. Barcelona are also in the race with the La Liga giants even holding a three-hour meeting with the defender's representatives this week. Quizzed on Rudiger's future before Chelsea's game against Brentford on Saturday, Tuchel insisted he remains hopeful the Blues will tie him down to a fresh contract. "The situation is the situation. Our hands our tied. We can't speak to him or offer him. We can't negotiate with his agent so fair enough if he listens to other offers. But I'm still confident," he said. Rudiger is not the only Chelsea defender with an uncertain future. Both Andreas Christensen and Cesar Azpilicueta are looking likely to leave in the summer with Barcelona having agreements in place for both players. The Blues are currently unable to negotiate fresh terms with their players until their protracted takeover is complete, with Tuchel admitting that these constraints were affecting the club's long-term planning. "It's impossible to plan for the summer. It's why we don't do it. Maybe it's an advantage because we don't get distracted," he explained.
