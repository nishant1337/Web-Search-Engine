The Brazilian played 85 minutes of Los Blancos' 2-1 victory over Celta Vigo on Saturday before being substituted, and he looked to be struggling physically. However, his presence in London during the week is not expected to be in danger, with reports indicating he was taken off due to cramps and the move was more precautionary. Real's clash with Celta Vigo saw the visiting side awarded three penalties, one of which came from Militao being fouled. Karim Benzema scored two of them to secure victory for Carlo Ancelotti's side, though the Italian was absent from the touchline after contracting Covid-19. Saturday's game was a pretty controversial one. Alongside Real's three penalties, Celta also had a goal disallowed for offside, with striker Iago Aspas later saying: "The only thing missing was a fourth penalty to shoot it himself [referee Gonzalez Fuertes]."

On the penalties, he revealed: ���I saw the first and the second. It was hard to see the third from my goal, but if you put your foot in, then...we���ve had penalties like that given against us too. It���s the first time in ages that we���ve had three penalties in one game." On the offside call, the Belgian added: ���He heads it, I make a good save onto the post. Iago���s offside and then prevents Alaba from clearing the ball. That���s offside, he understands that and there���s no problem. "We go into Wednesday���s game in good form. Chelsea lost at home today and we have to be really strong for Wednesday. It���ll be a different game. We have to give more on Wednesday.
