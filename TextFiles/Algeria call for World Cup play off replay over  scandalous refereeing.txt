Karl Toko Ekambi���s 124th-minute winner ensured Cameroon booked their spot in Qatar later this year at the expense of Algeria, who were eliminated on the away goals rule. A statement from the FAF reads: "FAF officially lodges an appeal with FIFA against the scandalous arbitration which distorted the result of the match. "We are determined to use all the legally permitted votes to have their rights restored and to replay the match under conditions guaranteeing the honesty and partiality of the arbitration." Algeria are not the only national team taking issue with being knocked out in the recent play-offs. Egypt's second leg with Senegal was marred by the use of laser pointers in the ground and Mohamed Salah and co were also left with a smashed windscreen after fans threw objects at the team bus upon its arrival at the stadium.
