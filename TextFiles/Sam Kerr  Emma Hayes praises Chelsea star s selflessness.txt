Kerr netted a second-half brace with a pair of characteristic poacher's finishes as Chelsea maintained their lead at the WSL summit courtesy of a thumping 5-0 win over Reading on Sunday. The league's top scorer could have completed her hat-trick in the dying stages when the Blues were awarded a penalty after England was brought down - but was happy to let her strike partner take it and add to her tally for the day instead. "That���s what our environment is: put the team first, put your teammates first," said Hayes at full-time. "For Sam to do that for Beth is a real testament to the class and the quality that she has as a human being." England emphatically dispatched from 12 yards out for her second of the game, making it six goals in her last three outings in all competitions.

WSL roundup - gameweek 19 WSL goals of the week - gameweek 19 WSL team of the week: gameweek 19 The forward won the ball back inside the Reading half courtesy of some relentless harrying, fed Guro Reiten and busted a gut to make sure she was on the end of the Norway international's delivery. Her hard work came with a finish to match, thundering home a sweetly struck volley. "Beth was tireless in what she did for the team," Hayes added. "Second half she was superb, and I���m so pleased for her; she���s back amongst the goals, she���s performing well at a time we need everybody to do that. "I value everything that takes place on the training pitch. Her work this half of the season has been outstanding, she had a blip with the injury, but she���s kept her head down. Beth has done a great job of playing her part, but this half of the season she���s just improving and she���s contributing on a much bigger level and I���m really proud of her approach and she���s getting the rewards for all her hard work."
