Thiago impressed in Saturday's 2-0 win over Watford, in which Gomez made the most of a rare start to grab an assist for Diogo Jota's headed opener. "It's a special team," Gomez told the club's official website. "Thiago is one of many, we [have] got so much talent in this team. "Sometimes I don't see them [passes], even if you're receiving them, you just get surprised that he comes your way but that is one of his qualities, I think, breaking lines and advancing us, always looking to play a forward pass is one of his top attributes. We have such a strong midfield [group]." Gomez, who also confessed to working on his attacking game as he tries to battle with Trent Alexander-Arnold for a spot on the right of Liverpool's defence, admitted his focus is now on forcing his way back into the England squad.
