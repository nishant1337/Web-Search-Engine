Fred salvaged a point for the subpar Red Devils after Kelechi Iheanacho had put the visitors in front, while the hosts' blushes were spared when James Maddison's late winner was chalked off by VAR. Club captain Maguire, who was heavily defended by players and coaches alike after England fans booed him over the international break, played alongside Raphael Varane at the back, but unusually started on the right-hand side of their partnership. "Since I arrived, we have been discussing this because he prefers to play on the left side although he is right footed," Rangnick told Man Utd's website about the tactical tweak. "And now I saw him play for England last week when he played in a back four on the right side, that's why I decided that he should play on the right side which is better for him anyway when we open up the game from our backline for him as a right-footed player.
