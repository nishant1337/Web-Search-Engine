Spurs have moved ahead of Arsenal into fourth place in the Premier League standings, but the two sides are level on points and Arteta's men still have two games in hand over their rivals - leading to Conte proclaiming that it would be a 'miracle' if his side finished in the top four. Arteta was asked about Conte's comments and, more specifically, whether he was feeling the pressure from the Italian, but he did his best to keep his composure. "I don���t know," he laughed. "That is a question for [Conte]. "But what we want to do is very clear, and the perception of what people think is not going to change it. I do it [mind games] more with my players, I think. I do it more with the players, if I have to. To get what I want from them."
