Liverpool predicted lineup vs Benfica Benfica vs Liverpool head-to-head record These two giants of European football have met ten times over the course of their illustrious histories. Their most recent encounter came back in the knockout stages of the 2009/10 Europa League, with Liverpool prevailing 5-3 on aggregate.
