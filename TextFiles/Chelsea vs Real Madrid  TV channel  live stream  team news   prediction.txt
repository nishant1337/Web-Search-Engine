Thomas Tuchel most recently saw his men have their six-match winning run abruptly ended by a shocking 4-1 home defeat at the hands of relegation-threatened Brentford, as they look set for a third-place finish in the Premier League. Meanwhile, Carlo Ancelotti's side did manage to bounce back and scrape a 2-1 win against Celta Vigo last time out, although will undoubtedly need more time to put a monumentally disheartening 4-0 El Clasico loss at the Santiago Bernabeu out of their minds - a 12-point gap at the La Liga summit will help with that, though. Here's 90min's preview of a reply of last season's semi final.

J��r��me Brisard (FRA) Chelsea team news Christian Pulisic was a late return from international duty and missed the defeat to Brentford, but could come into the side for this one having scored against Real last season. Reece James came off the bench to mark a return from injury last time out and could be set to start in midweek, allowing Tuchel to potentially revert to a three-man back line. Meanwhile, Ben Chilwell and Callum Hudson-Odoi will both remain out of contention due to their respective injury issues. Chelsea predicted lineup vs Real Madrid Real Madrid team news Real look in good shape ahead of this clash, although there will be no homecoming for Eden Hazard this time around as he continues his spell on the sidelines following surgery. Luka Jovic will also miss out due to injury, while Isco has been omitted from the squad with what is claimed to be a back problem - although that didn't stop him from joining in with training on Tuesday. Ancelotti himself may not even be present for the game, having tested positive for Covid-19. Real Madrid predicted lineup vs Chelsea Chelsea vs Real Madrid score prediction It's never simple to predict colossal clashes like this one. You could say that the sides have undertaken a role-reversal of sorts since their semi-final meeting last term - this time out, Chelsea are enduring a fairly underwhelming campaign by last season's standards, while Real Madrid look good for the La Liga title and have enjoyed barnstorming spells under Ancelotti this year. But that's not to say we'll have an opposite outcome from last time; performances haven't been consistently glowing for Los Blancos in recent weeks - notably that thrashing at the hands of Barcelona - and, as reigning European champions and having recently refound their nack of consistently winning football matches (prior to a painful defeat at the weekend, anyway), the Blues should feel confident heading into the tie. There's no clear favourite in a game between two slight outsiders for European glory and, with Real's ability to adapt within games and play varying styles, the tie may be decided in the reverse fixture - just like last time.
