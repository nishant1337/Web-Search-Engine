Spurs are well placed to make a late charge into the top four after a recent run of good form, although their 12 point haul from a possible last 15 has been mirrored by north London rivals Arsenal. The Gunners currently hold all the cards, sitting fourth with three points more than Spurs, and Mikel Arteta's side have a game in hand. However, Conte says his team are ready to fight between now and the end of the season to achieve their goals, claiming that qualifying for European football's premier competition will help him make "good decisions" this summer. "Every single player understands that we are in the right way to become a strong team and are ready to fight for an important target," Conte told his press conference ahead of Sunday's game with Newcastle. "This is very important. "Now we have nine games and have to be focused. The players have to be focused to give their maximum. To finish in the Champions League would be a great achievement for everybody and allow us to take different decisions and good decisions for me. For sure it will be very important." Conte also answered the inevitable questions about Harry Kane's future at Tottenham, with many assuming that England's captain won't want to stick around to play Europa League or Europa Conference League football after trying to engineer an exit from the club last year. The Italian reinforced his belief that any manager worth their salt would want Kane in their side, hinting that Spurs' chances of keeping him would be greatly increased with Champions League qualification. "I think that my answer is not useful! You're talking about a player that every manager wants in his own team. "You know there's a great connection with Harry. He's a really world-class striker and one of the most important players in the world. For sure, yes, if I have to decide for him. It would be very important to have a good final of the season." Kane has bagged 12 Premier League goals so far this season, including eight in his last seven games, and is well known for finishing the season strongly during his career to date.
