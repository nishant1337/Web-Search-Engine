Goalkeeper & defenders Tipped over the crossbar ? @emilyjramsey ?#BarclaysFAWSL @BCFCWomen pic.twitter.com/iAjp5rDOYz ��� Barclays FA Women's Super League (@BarclaysFAWSL) April 1, 2022 Emily Ramsey (GK) - Birmingham: Made important saves that contributed to a second Blues clean sheet of the season and only a third game that didn't end in defeat. Ona Batlle (RB) - Man Utd: One of her team's more effective attacking threats in a tightly fought game against Brighton. Made surging runs from deep and provided a number of teasing crosses. Hayley Ladd (CB) - Man Utd: Continued to fill in at the back and looked comfortable in doing so. Always alert to danger and her skill as a midfielder actually ensured she was also very good in possession. Rachel Corsie (CB) - Aston Villa: An assist for her team's winner, a goal-line clearance and a clean sheet underpinned an important result. She rarely misplaced a pass and was excellent in repelling danger. Guro Reiten (LB) - Chelsea: Added two more assists to her tally for the season, laying on her team's second and third goals that ultimately took the game away from Reading. 2. Midfielders West Ham's Yui Hasegawa played well despite defeat / Jacques Feeney/GettyImages Lia Walti (CM) - Arsenal: Close to flawless in possession, whether it was passing short or long, really helping the Gunners control things against a Leicester side that didn't back off until the second half. Yui Hasegawa (CM) - West Ham: Arguably unfortunate to end up on the losing side this weekend. She showed plenty of energy, had obvious class on the ball and was at the heart of everything good her team did. Caroline Weir (CM) - Man City: The Scot's class ultimately told as City were able to see off West Ham. Just two passes all game went astray and it was her assist for the second goal that put the game to bed. 3. Forwards Two goals each this weekend ������������ Who is winning the Golden Boot, @samkerr1 or @VivianneMiedema? #BarclaysFAWSL pic.twitter.com/cEykyPKUFo ��� Barclays FA Women's Super League (@BarclaysFAWSL) April 3, 2022 Sam Kerr (FW ) - Chelsea: Two more goals for the season in Chelsea's ruthless win, now averaging one every 75 minutes that she has played in the WSL so far in 2021/22 Bethany England (FW) - Chelsea: Scored twice for the second successive match, as well as getting another assist, and is making the most of a run of starts after a bit-part role for most of the season. Vivianne Miedema (FW) - Arsenal: Returned to a more conventional striker role after recently operating in a deeper 'number 10' role and marked it with two goals to ensure Kerr isn't totally running away with the golden boot.
