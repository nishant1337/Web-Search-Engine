Earlier this week, the Tigers were linked with a sensational swoop for the playmaker, after he fell out with current Fenerbahce manager Ismail Kartal. New Hull owner Acun Ilicali, who completed his takeover of the club in January, is said to be close friends with Ozil, leading to suggestions that a deal could be struck. However, according to Hull Live, the player will not be making a switch to the Championship side. Despite his falling out with the powers that be in Istanbul, Ozil's agent recently asserted that his client would be remaining at Fenerbahce, seemingly coorborating these reports. ���Mesut did not want to make it difficult in the current environment," Erkut Sogut said.

That's what makes sense right now because of the sad events with the coach. Such events are always sad. An unpleasant process has begun for both sides. The important thing is to stay calm and wait for the final decision. "I say this clearly here. Mesut will not go anywhere, and he certainly has no plans to leave. He will continue here as a Fenerbahce player for two more years until the end of his contract. "He signed Fenerbahce for three-and-a-half years, six months of which he played for free. From January to the end of the season, he didn't even make any money. "Mesut did not go out and denigrate anyone. What happened there will stay there. If his punishment comes, it will be taken and it will end."
